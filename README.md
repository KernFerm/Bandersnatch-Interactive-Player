# üéÆ Bandersnatch Interactive Player

This is an interactive web-based video player inspired by Netflix's *Bandersnatch*, enabling branching video narratives where users choose what happens next.

> ‚ù§Ô∏è This project is being maintained in memory of a child who loved the *Bandersnatch* experience and was heartbroken when Netflix removed the movie and the game disappeared. This player is a tribute to preserving that creativity and choice-driven storytelling for others to enjoy and learn from.
